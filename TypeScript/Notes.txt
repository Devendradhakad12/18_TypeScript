What is Type Script  -


TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means that all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, but TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed to make it easier to build and maintain large-scale, complex applications by providing type checking during development, which can help catch errors and improve code quality.

Here's a concise answer for an interview:

"TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It adds optional static typing to JavaScript, making it easier to catch errors during development and improving code quality, especially in large-scale applications."

You can expand on this answer during the interview by discussing the benefits of TypeScript, its features, and how it can be integrated into web development projects for improved maintainability and developer productivity.
